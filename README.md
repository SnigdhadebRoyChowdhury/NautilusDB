## What is NautilusDB?

NautilusDB is a micro database engine designed for local use, with a focus on simplicity, transparency, and user control.

Given the wide array of local databases already available, itâ€™s reasonable to ask: *Why create another one?*

The motivation behind NautilusDB is both practical and personal. I often find myself needing to store and retrieve information thatâ€™s not frequently accessedâ€”details that, when required, are either forgotten or lost in an unclear storage location. Additionally, some of the data I need to store contains personal or sensitive details. While existing solutions could serve this purpose, I wanted a system that I could fully understand, audit, and trust.

As an engineer, the idea of building a minimal, self-contained database felt like a worthwhile challengeâ€”an opportunity to explore core database concepts while creating something useful for day-to-day information management. Additionally, in an era where software complexity and external dependencies can introduce significant security risks, having full control over data storage and access mechanisms became a priority for me.

So I started building NautilusDBâ€”a simple, transparent, and self-contained database. 

The name? Itâ€™s inspired by a favorite sci-fi book of mine ðŸ™‚.
