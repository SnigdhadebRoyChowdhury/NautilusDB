NautilusDB is a database that has been created to understand how databases work under the hood

## What is NautilusDB

NautilusDB is a ***micro database*** currently intended for local use only.

You might ask: Why build yet another local database? After all, plenty of options already exist.

Well, this project started as something personal. I found myself needing to remember lots of scattered information—things I don't use often, but when I do need them, I'm either unable to recall the details or can't remember where I stored them.

Sure, I could’ve used an existing database. But I’m an engineer, and the idea of building my own lightweight solution sounded like a fun challenge—something to tinker with in my free time. More importantly, with growing concerns around cybersecurity and data privacy, I wasn’t entirely comfortable storing personal information in systems I didn’t fully understand or control.

So I started building NautilusDB—a simple, transparent, and self-contained database. The name? It’s inspired by a favorite sci-fi book of mine.
